### Features

###### Sign-In

Users enter the application via the home page.  Links on the top of the page will route you to different sections of the app without having to refresh.  

In order to access your personal "Fridge," navigate to the sign in page. After submitting your email and a password, the authentication form saves your information on to your local computer. The application then uses Json web tokens to mask user information from other users.  Once signed in, you can save your fridge items!

###### Your Fridge

On the Fridge page you can enter all sorts of ingredients (not just cold goods) into your "fridge" by entering information into the "add food" form.  When you are ready press the "Add To Fridge" button.  This will add the food you entered into your virtual fridge below.

Don't worry! If you run out of an item you can remove the item with the red "remove" button to the right.  

###### Recipes

As you enter ingredients into your fridge, possible recipes will render from our recipes API, to the right of your fridge.  Scroll through these options and choose to your heart's content.  We have made a page for just recipes if you enjoy perusing.
